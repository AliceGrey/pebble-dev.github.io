## Rebble

### What is Rebble?

Rebble began as a supplement to the [official Pebble documentation](https://developer.pebble.com/).  After [Pebble ceased operations](https://blog.getpebble.com/2016/12/07/fitbit/), it morphed into the unofficial spearhead organization for continuing the advancement of the Pebble platform via the amazing Pebble developer community.  

### What does Rebble do?

Our present focus is on replacing key pieces of the Pebble ecosystem: the appstore, firmware, and mobile apps.  At a higher level, our goal is to maintain and advance Pebble functionality, in the absence of *Pebble Technology Corp*.  

### Who is Rebble?

Find out on our [team](/team) page!  

### Where can I learn more about Rebble?

Join us on the *officially* unofficial [Pebble Dev Discord server](http://discord.gg/aRUAYFN), then head to `#rebirth` to find out what we're up to! :bowtie:
