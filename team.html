                 I have a lot of energy and motivation and tend to find myself at the center of projects like this (see also e.g. <a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/579841731482cdda2b000061">Pokemon GO Radar</a>.  I enjoy bringing people together, creating excitement, fostering teams, and building amazing things.  <a href="https://github.com/jneubrand">@jneubrand</a> and I started the <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki">wiki</a>/<a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev">org</a> that eventually mutated to become <a href="http://rebble.io/">Rebble</a>. :heart: to everyone else who's joined in since - what we're going to accomplish here is mind-blowing! :bowtie:
