## Firmware

* [@ginge](https://github.com/ginge) has been focusing on [refactoring his FreeRTOS port](https://github.com/ginge/FreeRTOS-Pebble) recently, after implementing DMA for faster display refreshing, UART for smartstrap-based debugging, and making first contact with the power management IC and accelerometer; if you're not sure what all that means, [enjoy a nice video instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7jF3eiRud0) :grin:
* after fully annotating the [IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml) database for the Pebble/Pebble Steel bootloder from QEMU, [@jwise](https://github.com/jwise) now has a [checkerboard running on real Pebble Steel hardware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ObGakFxnSs), and is beginning to reverse the original Pebble's firmware binary
* [@jneubrand](https://github.com/jneubrand)'s [neographics](https://github.com/pebble-dev/neographics) library currently supports paths and primitives, with drawcommands in the works!

Community members who speak non-English languages (which are based on the Latin alphabet) are kindly asked to contact `@johannesn#4019` via [Discord](http://discord.gg/aRUAYFN) for proofreading. :heart: [@jneubrand](https://github.com/jneubrand) also created a fantastic [wiki page on the format](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Firmware-Font-Format) and is [looking for feedback on his ligature support proposal](https://github.com/pebble-dev/wiki/wiki/Firmware-Font-Format#ligatures-proposal)
