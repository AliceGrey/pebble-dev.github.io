Hello world! It's been a while since we last talked. A lot has happened, Fitbit is still being purchased by [Google](https://www.clubindustry.com/news/fitbits-shareholders-approve-acquisition-google) and Pine64 has been shipping their [dev kits](https://store.pine64.org/?product=pinetime-dev-kit) for their new watch.
Lot's has happened behind the scenes since last November. Let's Explore!

### Dev Portal - Now with more zip files
Want to add your cool new pebble app to the Rebble store but don't know how? Good news!
The developer portal for submitting apps to the rebble store has been published to [rebble.io/submit](https://rebble.io/submit/)
This will allow developers to submit apps in an easier fashion. 

### RebbleOS - A call to arms
There hasn't been much talk about RebbleOS in a while. For the uninitiated, RebbleOS is a FreeRTOS replacement firmware for pebble. 
It currently is fairly limited but steady advancements are being made in bringing it to parity with pebbles original firmware.
If you have any interest in open source development(software dev, graphic design, web dev, documentation) we would greatly appreciate your assistance.

Recent Advancements: 
BlobDB - jwise has been busy working on the RebbleOS filesystem and database. 
Automated Testing - jwise has also been working on adding automated testing to RebbleOS to prevent future bugs that may crop up. 
Building Documentation - AliceGrey(Oh hey that's me!) has updated the Arch and Debian build guides to help new developers get up to speed on compiling RebbleOS.
